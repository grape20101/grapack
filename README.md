This is PCGXLEP, a Resource Pack for Minecraft. PCGXLEP stands for Phimbleton Cerbendergan Grape Xmaoppe Linux Extraordinaire Pack.
It is mostly just funny jokes and tweaks that I find make the game more enjoyable. To complete your experience use:

### Mods
Optifine<br>
Optifabric<br>
Fabric API<br>
Just Enough Items<br>
Mouse Tweaks<br>

### Game Settings
Attack Indicator: Hotbar<br>
Monochrome Logo: On<br>
FOV: 90 or above<br>

Many things in this pack are taken from Vanilla Tweaks. The unedited 'Selected Packs.txt' is still in the resourcepack for you to look at.
