This is PCGXLEP, a Resource Pack for Minecraft. PCGXLEP stands for Phimbleton Cerbendergan Grape Xmaoppe Linux Extraordinaire Pack.
It is mostly just funny jokes and tweaks that I find make the game more enjoyable. To complete your experience use:

### Mods
Optifine
Optifabric
Fabric API
Just Enough Items
Mouse Tweaks

### Game Settings
Attack Indicator: Hotbar
Monochrome Logo: On
FOV: 90 or above

Many things in this pack are taken from Vanilla Tweaks. The unedited 'Selected Packs.txt' is still in the resourcepack for you to look at.
